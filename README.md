<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

### Motivation

I love cooking. I have been cooking and trying out different recipes and cuisines since I was in elementary school. Since I am from a
traditional South Asian household, my mom cooks primary traditional desi foods. I always enjoyed other cuisines be it Chinese, Mexican,
Italian etc. In order to eat these types of foods, I had to learn to cook them on my own with the ingredients we had at home in the pantry,
fridge, etc. I primarily learned various recipes like cooking Chicken Alfredo, Fried Rice, authentic Mexican tacos and much more by searching the web for blogs and videos on how to cook.

My goal was to create an app that can make these recipes easily accessible by searching with a few ingredients I have at home and saving the recipes in one place while being able to try new recipes without having to constantly search through Google and Youtube.

In addition, it was an opportunity to learn full stack web development using PERN stack and gain meaningful experience working with popular technologies.

### Design

Designed mockups for both desktop and mobile versions of web app on Figma. [Click here](https://www.figma.com/file/k3iBzpR3W6rNquxtG1Tltu/Recipe-Finder?node-id=0%3A1) to view mockups.

### Built With

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

### Additional Technologies Used:

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/)
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

Utilized the [Spoonacular Foof API](https://rapidapi.com/spoonacular/api/recipe-food-nutrition) to get recipe data.
